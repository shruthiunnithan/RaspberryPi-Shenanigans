# raspberryPi-shenanigans
Fun fact, I did my first ever coding project with a Raspberry Pi. I used Python to program a small robotic car and showed off my hard work at my 5th grade science fair. Funny enough, I never touched the Pi again until recently. 

With the research I'm working on through the RaceLab at UCSB, I thought I would go back to my roots and experiment with my old Raspberry Pi to obtain a better understanding. 

With that, this repo is mainly me playing around with the functionalities of the Raspberry Pi and hopefully making progress that I can end up using in my research project.

Also, I'm using this as an opportunity to get more comfortable with Git! Git scares me, even though I've used it multiple times for my classes. I think I never played around with it because I was always scared that I would break something.
