# raspberryPi-shenanigans
Crazy story, but I did my first ever coding project with a Raspberry Pi. Funny enough, I never touched the Pi again until recently. 

With the research I'm working on through the RaceLab at UCSB, I thought I would go back and experiment with my old Raspberry Pi to have a better skill set. 

With that, this repo is mainly me playing around with the functionalities of the Raspberry Pi and hopefully making progress that I can end up using in my research project.
